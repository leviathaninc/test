	Dear Aunt Joanne,\\\\
	
	I wanted to thank you for your generous gift and for taking the time and effort to come to Chico for me, even if it meant you had to take Spirit airlines. It was great seeing you at the commencement ceremony and being able to spend time with you was great. Spending time with you and the others meant the world to me and I can't wait to see you all again soon.\\\\
	
	With love,
